                Welcome! I’m Nicole, a software developer with a focus on building 
                efficient and reliable solutions. I enjoy working on challenging projects 
                and continuously improving my skills in software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently pursuing a <strong>Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech</strong> (online) 
                and previously earned my <strong>Bachelor’s in Computer Science</strong> (with a minor in Mathematics) 
                from UNLV, graduating Magna Cum Laude.
            </p>
            <p>
            Outside of coding, I have a passion for game development and drawing, which allow me to combine creativity 
            with problem-solving in unique ways.
            </p>
